"""
location API manager
Main Zone for demo:zone02 (many options for historical tourism spots, food, mesuems) 
Demo for communication across zones (hospital in zone01)

Step 1: once user initiate the conversation, retrieve live location. Refresh every [1] min (or area enter subscription), saved in json file as log events data
Step 2: retrieve the surrounding locations within [5] meters of user coordinates, saved in [?] a list nearby_locations_list
Step 3: based on the goal of the conversation / chat history, gather {data} from these locations, saved in [?].
Step 4: use the {data} to generate LLM response / translation
Step 5: fine-tuning model locally every 24 hours
