# the function to achieve in this script: a sample embeddings dataset in .csv that was indexed
# mechanism that converted the new input into embeddings quickly
# sentence-transformer semantic search new dataset vs. database (.cvs dataset)
# index to pull the needed data from database to use as an input in LLM
# give LLM the neccesary input + user live instruction, to generate best results
